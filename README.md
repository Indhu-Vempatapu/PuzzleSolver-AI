## 🧩 AI Puzzle Solver – GUI Based Interactive Visualization

## 📌 Project Goal
This project is an **AI-driven puzzle solver** for the classic 8-puzzle problem, implemented with a visually appealing and interactive Pygame GUI. It enables users to select various AI search algorithms such as **A\*, BFS, DFS, UCS, IDA\*,IDS** and Greedy Search to solve the puzzle. The core focus of this project is to **demonstrate how AI algorithms can intelligently navigate state spaces** and visually show their decision-making process step-by-step.

  🔍 This is an Artificial Intelligence-focused project that blends search algorithm strategies with an intuitive interface to enhance understanding of AI search  techniques in action.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pygame** – for GUI visualization
  - **NumPy** – matrix operations for board states
- **AI Algorithms**:
  - **BFS** - Breadth-First Search
  - **DFS** - Depth-First Search
  - **UCS** - Uniform Cost Search
  - **IDS** - Iterative Deepening Search
  - **A\*** - A-Star Search (with Manhattan Distance Heuristic)
  - **IDA\*** - Iterative Deepening A*
  - **Greedy** - Greedy Best-First Search
