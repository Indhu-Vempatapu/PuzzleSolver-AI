# PuzzleSolver-AI
#🧩 AI Puzzle Solver – GUI Based Interactive Visualization
#📌 Project Goal
This project is an AI-driven puzzle solver for the classic 8-puzzle problem, implemented with a visually appealing and interactive Pygame GUI. It enables users to select various AI search algorithms such as A*, BFS, DFS, UCS, IDS, IDA* and Greedy Search to solve the puzzle. The core focus of this project is to demonstrate how AI algorithms can intelligently navigate state spaces and visually show their decision-making process step-by-step.

  🔍 This is an Artificial Intelligence-focused project that blends search algorithm strategies with an intuitive interface to enhance understanding of AI search  techniques in action.

#🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
