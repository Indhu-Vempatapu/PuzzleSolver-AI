## 🧩 AI Puzzle Solver – GUI Based Interactive Visualization

## 📌 Project Goal
This project is an **AI-driven puzzle solver** for the classic 8-puzzle problem, implemented with a visually appealing and interactive Pygame GUI. It enables users to select various AI search algorithms such as **A\*, BFS, DFS, UCS, IDA\*,IDS** and Greedy Search to solve the puzzle. The core focus of this project is to **demonstrate how AI algorithms can intelligently navigate state spaces** and visually show their decision-making process step-by-step.

  🔍 This is an Artificial Intelligence-focused project that blends search algorithm strategies with an intuitive interface to enhance understanding of AI search  techniques in action.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
